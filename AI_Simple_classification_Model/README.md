## Introduction
This is an image classification model based on [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)

### What is Teachable Machine?

![Teachable Machine](./readme_images/teachablemachine.gif)

[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible for everyone. [You can try it here](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

### Who is it for?
Educators, artists, students, innovators, makers of all kinds â€“ really, anyone who has an idea they want to explore. No prerequisite machine learning knowledge required.

### How does it work?
You train a computer to recognize your images, sounds, and poses without writing any machine learning code. Then, use your model in your own projects, sites, apps, and more.

       . Train
      </h3>
      <p>
        Train your model, then instantly test it out to see whether it can correctly classify new examples.
